I hand adjusted the model's configuration for improved results.</p><p>Another major addition is the subtle but impactful "aaahhhs" added to the chorus and other louder parts of the song. It's sort of a choir holding a single note, which was achieved by time stretching Porter's (pitched) voice and applying a convolver to it with a "white noise blur" (heavily adjusted). It resulted in that nurturey sort of emotional anime vibe.</p><p>I bit crushed the very beginning of the song, as well as another part of the song that plays the square wave lead. This leads to a more arcade, "worlds" type sound. Which I think is really cool!</p><p>I ran the roformer instrumental stem through finetuned demucs, which can split the track into 4 stems, being: Vocals (which is irrelevant), Other, Bass, and Drums. The track I specifically targeted was the "Other" which contains everything except the others, and usually contains synths, guitars, piano, etc. I put this once at the beginning of the song, and a second time at the beginning of the second chorus, with that one having a sweeping highpass filter to give an "opening up" effect.</p><p>Overall, this took me about 2 ish hours to get right. Mostly the balancing, effects, and getting everything juuuust right!</p><p>The final sound is rich, full, and IMO, it sounds professionally produced and possibly the same level of mastering and production as the original.<br><br>Here is the song! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it! :)</p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pEL-m3-1_E0?si=aMPd1U9mKLWEmTCL" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 19, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://dill.moe/tags/blog/">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://dill.moe/media/website/1.png" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="1024" class="bio__avatar" alt=""><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://dill.moe/authors/cross-nastasi/" rel="author">Cross</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hello!</p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://dill.moe/a-bit-about-arnold-palmer/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> A Bit About Arnold Palmer</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>dill.moe</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://dill.moe/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://dill.moe/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
